# OBJECTIVE
Help the user start their day by reviewing yesterday's progress, planning today's priorities, and connecting daily tasks to active projects.

# WORKFLOW

## Step 0: Curate Daily Content (Background)

**Run content curation skills to gather today's opportunities:**

1. **Newsletter Curation:**
   - Run `/ai-newsletters` skill
   - Retrieves cached digest if already run today
   - Returns top 5 content opportunities with angles
   - Saves to `50_Resources/NewsLetter/YYYY-MM/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

2. **Product Launch Curation:**
   - Run `/ai-products` skill
   - Retrieves cached digest if already run today
   - Returns top 5 product launch opportunities with angles
   - Saves to `50_Resources/ProductLaunches/YYYY-MM/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

**Note:** These run in background at start. If they fail or take too long, continue with planning - content opportunities are nice-to-have, not blocking.

## Step 1: Gather Context

1. **Get Today's Date**
   - Determine current date (YYYY-MM-DD format)

2. **Read Yesterday's Daily Note**
   - If exists, read `10_Daily/[yesterday].md`
   - Note incomplete tasks and progress
   - Identify what was worked on

3. **Find Active Projects**
   - Search `20_Project/` for notes with `status: active`
   - Read each active project's:
     - Current phase and status
     - Pending tasks in Actions section
     - Last update in Progress section (to identify stale projects)
     - Any due dates or time-sensitive items in frontmatter or Context

4. **Check Inbox**
   - List files in `00_Inbox/` for quick captures that need processing
   - Identify any that could be quick wins or time-sensitive

5. **Analyze & Prioritize**
   - Identify time-sensitive items (deadlines, reservations, events)
   - Find projects not touched in 3+ days
   - Determine logical next steps for each active project
   - Find high-value inbox items worth processing

## Step 2: Generate Daily Plan File

Create a plan file in `90_Plans/` named `Plan_YYYY-MM-DD_Daily.md`

**Plan Format:**
```markdown
# Daily Plan: [Date]

## Context

**Yesterday's Carryover:**

## Step 3: Notify User

Output: "I have created your daily plan at `90_Plans/Plan_YYYY-MM-DD_Daily.md`. Please review, fill in your answers, and confirm to proceed."

## Step 4: Execution (After User Confirmation)

1. **Read the plan file** - Note all user answers and modifications

2. **Process Q2 answers (new ideas):**
   - For each new idea/task mentioned
   - Check if it exists in projects or inbox
   - If new, create `00_Inbox/[brief-title].md` with:
     ```yaml
     ---
     created: YYYY-MM-DD
     status: pending
     source: start-my-day
     ---

     [User's description]
     ```

3. **Create/Update today's daily note** using template:
   - Populate Priorities from Q1, Q3, or suggested priorities
   - Carry over incomplete tasks from yesterday
   - List active projects in Related Projects section

4. **Present completion summary:**
   ```
   ## Daily Plan Complete: [Date]

   **Created today's note:** [[YYYY-MM-DD]]

   **Your priorities:**
   - [ ] Priority 1
   - [ ] Priority 2
   - [ ] Priority 3

   **New ideas captured to inbox ([N]):**
   - [[Idea1]]
   - [[Idea2]]

   **Active projects:**
   - [[Project1]]
   - [[Project2]]

   **Content opportunities curated:**
   - 📰 Newsletters: [N] items from TLDR AI & The Rundown AI → [[YYYY-MM-DD]]
   - 🚀 Product Launches: [N] items from Product Hunt, HN, GitHub, Reddit → [[YYYY-MM-DD]]
   - Top picks ready for review when you're planning content

   ---

   Ready to start your day! Would you like to:
   1. Process inbox items (`/kickoff` or `/learn`)
   2. Review content opportunities (`/ai-newsletters` or `/ai-products`)
   3. Get started with your priorities
   ```

5. **Cleanup:** Move plan to `90_Plans/Archives/`

# IMPORTANT RULES

- **Run content curation first (Step 0)** - Call `/ai-newsletters` and `/ai-products` skills to populate content opportunities
- **Don't block on curation** - If curation fails or is slow, continue with planning
- **Always read yesterday's note if it exists** - don't assume it's empty
- **Create a plan file first** - Let user input their thoughts structured
- **Be specific in suggestions** - Don't just list projects, suggest actual next actions
- **Identify time-sensitive items** - Deadlines, reservations, events get priority
- **Flag stale projects** - Projects not touched in 3+ days need attention
- **Suggest concrete actions** - "Draft wireframes" not "work on project"
- **Highlight top content angles** - Identify 1-2 highest-potential opportunities from curation
- **Create today's note if it doesn't exist** - but don't overwrite if it does
- **Use the template** - ensures consistency across daily notes
- **Link everything** - projects, dates, and concepts should be wikilinked
- **Capture new ideas from Q2** - Create inbox items for anything mentioned
- **Respect user's input** - Use their answers to Q1-Q4 over suggestions
- **Clean up the plan** - Move to archives after execution

# EDGE CASES

- **No active projects:** Focus on inbox processing and suggest starting something new
- **No yesterday's note:** Skip carryover section
- **Weekend/Monday:** Note the gap and ask if a weekly review is needed
- **Empty inbox:** Celebrate and focus on project execution

# CAPTURING NEW IDEAS FROM Q2

**When processing Q2 answers:**

1. **Parse the answer** - Look for distinct ideas, tasks, or topics
2. **Cross-reference** - Check if mentioned in active projects or existing inbox
3. **Create inbox files for new items**
4. **Summarize what was captured** in the completion summary

**Examples:**
- Q2: "Want to learn React Server Components, need to fix auth bug"
  - Creates: `00_Inbox/Learn React Server Components.md`
  - Creates: `00_Inbox/Fix auth bug.md`

- Q2: "Thinking about redesigning the homepage"
  - Creates: `00_Inbox/Redesign homepage.md`

# CONTENT CURATION INTEGRATION

**How to integrate curation skills:**

1. **Call skills at workflow start (Step 0):**
   - Use Skill tool to invoke `ai-newsletters` skill
   - Use Skill tool to invoke `ai-products` skill
   - Both skills check cache first (no redundant work if already run today)

2. **Skills return structured output for `/start-my-day`:**
   - Newsletters: Top 5 items with title, angle, link
   - Products: Top 5 items with name, angle, metrics, link
   - Both include wikilink to full digest

3. **Integrate into plan file:**
   - Add "Content Opportunities" section to Context
   - List top 5 from each source with angles
   - Link to full digests in Resources

4. **Mention in recommendations:**
   - If user has content creation projects active, highlight top 1-2 opportunities
   - Otherwise, just note count and availability

5. **Include in completion summary:**
   - Show count of curated items
   - Link to digests for later review

**Error handling:**
- If skill fails: Continue without content section, note in summary
- If cache unavailable: Skills will fetch fresh data
- If both sources down: Skills use yesterday's data or skip gracefully
